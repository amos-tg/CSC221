# Reminder for Professor Sprague: 

the github accounts amos-tg & boodledot1 are both me. 

I have a laptop and a desktop, and they have different github accounts.
I haven't changed to my amos-tg account on my laptop because I would have to change my git config.
I might swap over soon though because boodledot1 is a pretty goofy name.
